Nix JavaScript transpiler and interpreter.

# Trying it out

Currently `nixjs` is not published anywhere, so you'll have to build it yourself.
Please follow instructions in [`CONTRIBUTE.md`](./CONTRIBUTE.md) on how to build
and run `nixjs`.

Keep in mind that `nixjs` is still in development and many features are not yet
implemented.
